    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While I was working on my mac, I got a pop up to update Java running on it.
I did all the process that was required. It was also needed by one of my application being developed in Android Studio on latest platform. But when I  checked the version number using <code>System Preferences &gt; Java</code> which opens the Java Control Panel in a separate window. If you click on the <code>About</code> button under <code>General</code> tab of this new window, it displays the Version details which said the following and with other copyright information:</p>

<!-- more -->


<pre><code>Version 8 Update 31 (build 1.8.0_31-b13)
</code></pre>

<p>It was time to check within Terminal as well by following command:</p>

<pre><code>java -version
</code></pre>

<p>That returned an older version of Java. <code>java version "1.6.xxx"</code>
I then wasted my time to solve this odd issue. Finally, I got a solution that I also need to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">update JDK</a> to work with Android Studio. Agree to the terms and conditions and download the file based on the product you have.</p>

<p>Following the above steps, solved my version issue due to which I was not able to work with Android Studio. And running the above java version command in Terminal returned correct version.</p>

<p>While searching for the solution online, there were many other ways as well and obviously it depends on different kind of issues with java versions with XCode or Eclipse or Android Studio.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often find myself installing a software or package for my projects while working on mac where I need to add a specific path to my $PATH variable.
So, I thought to write this quick post. Below is the directions to achieve the above goals:</p>

<!-- more -->


<ul>
<li>Open Terminal on Mac from Applications or Spotlight.</li>
<li>Now run the command below:</li>
</ul>


<pre><code> sudo nano /etc/paths
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>When prompted, you need to enter your password and hit Enter.</li>
<li>If your password is correct, you will be shown a file. Go to the bottom of the file and enter the new path.</li>
<li>Hit control + x to quit.</li>
<li>Enter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; to save the modified buffer.</li>
</ul>


<p>So, above are the steps you need to take in order to add a new path to $PATH variable on mac. To test it, open a new terminal window and type:</p>

<pre><code> echo $PATH
</code></pre>

<p>You will be able to see all the paths that exists including the one your have recently added. If in case, you don&rsquo;t see the path added by you then try following the above steps carefully.</p>
