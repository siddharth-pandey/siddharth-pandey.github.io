    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had a need to use HTML5 LocalStorage API in my web application project. The requirement was to save the vertical scroll position of window when a user drills down to low level details by navigating to other view.
I didn&rsquo;t wanted to cookies because cookies are sent on every request to the server and I have no need to send this detail to the server as it is just related to client.</p>

<p>Then I was left with LocalStorage and SessionStorage as options. I found that SessionStorage is not maintained when the page reloads and when the browser is closed. <!-- more --> So, I opted to use LocalStorage API for this use case and came up with the code below which is a localStorageWrapper module that can be accessed as a module when using RequireJS (a module loader). A client consuming this wrapper is able to set, get, check the existence of a key and clear all the items in client&rsquo;s localStorage. An item that can be save is made up of a key and a value. This value can be just a string or an javascript object that can be JSON stringified and then saved. This can be seen in the set function of the localStorageWrapper module below.</p>

<p>When using these fancy new HTML5 APIs, one should care about the browser support. You can use <a href="www.caniuse.com">CanIuse</a> website to check it. This is a very good resource to check support for everything and anything related to web.</p>

<pre><code>define([], function ($) {
    'use strict';
    var localStorageWrapper = {

        /* add data to localStorage */
        set: function (key, value) {

            /* if the value is an object, stringify it to save it in localStorage */
            if (typeof value === 'object') {
                value = JSON.stringify(value);
            }

            localStorage.setItem(key, value);
        },

        /* retrieve data from localStorage object */
        get: function (key) {
            var data;

            if (!this.hasData(key)) {
                return false;
            }

            data = localStorage[key];

            /* if the data is JSON, try to parse */
            try {
                return JSON.parse(data);
            } catch (e) {
                return data;
            }
        },

        /* check if the item exists and it has data */
        hasData: function (key) {
            return !!localStorage[key] &amp;&amp; !!localStorage[key].length;
        },

        /* clear all the saved items in client's localstorage */
        clear: function() {
            localStorage.clear();
        }
    };


    return localStorageWrapper;
});
</code></pre>

<p>To properly provide graceful degradation, you can use <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> to check if client supports a particular HTML5 feature.
When using Modernizr, the client code consuming the above module looks like:</p>

<pre><code>    // using set member of localStorageWrapper
    if (Modernizr.localstorage) 
    {
        localStorage.set("uniqueKey1", "");
    }

    // using clear member of localStorageWrapper
    if (Modernizr.localstorage) 
    {
        localStorage.clear();
    }

    // using hasData and get member of localStorageWrapper
    if (localStorage.hasData("uniqueKey1"))
    {
        var value = localStorage.get("uniqueKey1");
    }
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are reading this article you might already know what <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a> has to offer but the post aims to give you some working demo instead of a content based approach. If you are looking for a documentation it is available on their website and it offers a step-by-step guide. But while using it, I have found that there was a lack of demo that how to really use its features in real world, so, I thought of creating a <a href="http://codepen.io/siddharth-pandey/full/JbKhC">demo</a> which you can fork it and keep it for your own reference.</p>
