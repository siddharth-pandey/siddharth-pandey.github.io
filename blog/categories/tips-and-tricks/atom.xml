    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I spend most of my programming time within Visual Studio and I never liked the white theme that came out of the box. Same is with the Chrome Developer Tools. I use Dark theme for Visual Studio and want something similar for Chrome as well.</p>

<p>In version 32, custom.css was removed from Chrome. I&rsquo;ll be using an theme extension to setup a custom theme. The old way was to play with a local css file that you can rely on or add your own files.</p>

<p>There are many extensions which can help you to have this customization. For my purpose, I&rsquo;m going to use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/devtools-theme-zero-dark/bomhdjeadceaggdgfoefmpeafkjhegbo">DevTools Theme: Zero Dark Matrix</a>. Click on the link and install it to add it to Chrome.</p>

<p>Follow the steps below:
 - You need to enable a feature by navigating to <a href="chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments">chrome://flags/#enable-devtools-experiments</a>.
 - Once enabled, restart chrome.
 - Open Developer Tools and select Settings or gear icon at top right corner.
 - You should see an Experiments tab there, now enable <strong>Allow Custom User Themes.</strong>
 - Reload Developer Tools and you should now have the extension theme enabled.</p>

<p>See it was that easy to have a dark theme. However, if you want to create your own custom style, you will need to create your own extension. You could of course also just change the installed extension stylesheet, but you might want to check the licensing for whether its allowed or not!</p>

<p>If you have followed all the steps above, your developer tools will look like:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you spent any time thinking of which font to choose while writing a word or any other document either on your laptop, online, etc.? Will it not be easier to have your own handwriting available to you even when you don&rsquo;t hold a pen in hand and instead press keys on laptop?</p>

<p>I answered it as ah yes, but that must be hard? No, its not. Some dev friends have created a free tool that can be used by anyone to create a font based on your handwriting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.myscriptfont.com/">My Script Font</a> is the free service where you can download/print a template and then write with a pen and then upload it as in of the supporting formats: JPEG, TIFF or PNG. You may name your font and then select a formatL TTF, SVG or OTF to get the file.</p>

<p>Your custom font&rsquo;s browser support: <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=svg">SVG</a> &amp; <a href="http://caniuse.com/#search=ttf">TTF/OTF</a>. Once you grab your font file, just install on your local machine and you will be able to write any document in your own style as shown in the image below:</p>
